# Isolated Environments

Bailo is built to be deployed on isolated environments, where access to the internet is strictly regulated. To install
Bailo on a segregated environment you will need the following dependencies.

## Helm Charts

We rely on the following Bitnami charts:

- MinIO https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
- MongoDB https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

## Docker Images

We rely on the following images:

- mongo:6.0.4
- minio/minio:RELEASE.2023-01-31T02-24-19Z
- marlonb/mailcrab:v0.10.0
- nginx:1.21.6-alpine
- registry:2.8.1
- node:22-alpine

These will occassionally be updated. To retrieve the latest versions used, check `./docker-compose.yml` and
`./backend/Dockerfile`. These versions can be configured using the `tag` attribute for each image in `values.yaml` to
override the defaults. In general, keeping to the same major version will maintain compatability with Bailo.

## NPM

We rely on many NPM packages. The full list is available in `package-lock.json`, `frontend/package-lock.json` and
`backend/package-lock.json`. Most are standard packages with the exception of:

- `sharp`, which is an optimised image transformer and requires some compilation tools.
- `cypress`, which is a user interface testing tool and requires a Chromium download.

`sharp` includes instructions on installing / building without internet [here](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/install).
Instructions on installing `cypress` without internet are available
[here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/advanced-installation).
