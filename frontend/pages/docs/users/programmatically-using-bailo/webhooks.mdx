# Webhooks

Bailo provides webhooks for programmatic, event-driven interactions with individual models for interfacing with external
applications.

## Events

A Bailo model's webhook events are:

- `createRelease`
- `updateRelease`
- `createReviewResponse`
- `createAccessRequest`

To view and configure webhooks for a given model, refer to the Webhook section of our [api docs](./open-api).

## Body

Webhooks have the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "name": "webhook",
  "uri": "http://host:8080/webhook",
  "token": "abcd",
  "insecureSSL": false,
  "events": ["createRelease", "updateRelease", "createReviewResponse", "createAccessRequest"],
  "active": true
}
```

`token`, `events` and `active` are all optional fields.

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
