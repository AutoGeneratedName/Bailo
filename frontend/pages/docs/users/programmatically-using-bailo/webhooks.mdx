# Webhooks

Bailo provides webhooks for programmatic, event-driven interactions with individual models for interfacing with external
applications.

## Events

A Bailo model's webhook events are:

- `createRelease`
- `updateRelease`
- `createReviewResponse`
- `createAccessRequest`

To view and configure webhooks for a given model, refer to the Webhook section of our [api docs](./open-api).

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
